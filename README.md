# ToDoList

This app includes a ToDo-list. You can mark the ToDo's as complete or incomplete, edit, or add a ToDo. The app saves the list to your documents folder on your device. It's a simple, but efficient layout. You can set a due date to your ToDo and add notes to describe the ToDo. When you click on the due date, the cell expands with a date picker. When you add a new ToDo, you have to enter a title for your ToDo before you can click on the save button. You can press enter to save your ToDo title.
